# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, What commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc. It is exactly what it sounds like, a status check.

Its a command that is safe to use at any time. If you want to see what is going on its good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know the flow better.

```
git add.
git status

git commit m- "modified lading page"
sit staus

git push
git status
```
